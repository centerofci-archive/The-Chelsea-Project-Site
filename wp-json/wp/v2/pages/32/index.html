While PCR testing remains the gold standard for COVID-19&nbsp;diagnosis, frequent rapid antigen tests are highly specific for positive results (if you test positive, you likely have the virus), and results are available within a short 15-minute window. Additionally, antigen tests allow for frequent usage because they are affordable&nbsp;and can be performed at home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The appearance of the virus in asymptomatic individuals makes it almost impossible to detect unless a monitoring system is employed routinely. The idea behind frequent antigen rapid test protocols is to monitor the appearance of a COVID-19 case early in the infection and to quarantine the positive case before the virus&nbsp;transmits&nbsp;to&nbsp;others in the community. Especially with breakthrough infections on the rise, affordable testing is an effective tool to monitor new cases and quickly prevent&nbsp;the further spread of the virus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This project aims to monitor COVID-19 cases in three congregate living settings in the city of Chelsea, MA. Many of the residents in these buildings are seniors, people with disabilities,&nbsp;and&nbsp;people whose primary language is not English. Our public health mission is to bring access to frequent testing to people for whom it might be challenging to obtain&nbsp;COVID-19&nbsp;tests otherwise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Residents will enroll on a volunteer basis and agree to be tested&nbsp;once a&nbsp;week for four months. The tests will be self-performed and\/or supported by the project staff on site. A data management system will register&nbsp;participants, label test kits, collect participant responses, capture test strip&nbsp;images, monitor program performance,&nbsp;and report results.&nbsp;A confirmatory PCR test will be conducted in case of a positive test result, and participants will quarantine&nbsp;according to the usual Center of Disease&nbsp;Control and&nbsp;Prevention&nbsp;and Public Health recommendations already&nbsp;established.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"729\" src=\"https:\/\/thechelseaproject.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/team-photo-1024x729.jpg\" alt=\"Chelsea Project\" class=\"wp-image-340\" srcset=\"https:\/\/thechelseaproject.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/team-photo-1024x729.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/thechelseaproject.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/team-photo-300x214.jpg 300w, https:\/\/thechelseaproject.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/team-photo-768x547.jpg 768w, https:\/\/thechelseaproject.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/team-photo-1536x1093.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/thechelseaproject.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/team-photo-2048x1457.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kayanaszymczak.com\/\">Kayana Szymczak<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Rapid antigen tests&nbsp;for&nbsp;COVID-19&nbsp;are a cost-effective tool to monitor \u2018infectious\u2019 individuals&nbsp;in a community&nbsp;irrespective of their symptomatic status.
